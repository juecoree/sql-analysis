### 1. Analysis Background <hr>
Recently, the @steemph.cebu bot was re-configured to establish a new voting mechanism in line with the new delegation system launch by @steemph.cebu community.  The new voting rules were implemented on May 26. Wherein, voting weight received by the community members are depended on the amount of SP delegated to @steemph.cebu account. 

Currently, the @steemph.cebu holds approximately 7,000 SP through delegation and from the original SP of the communal account. As the new system is in place, authors will be voted by the @steemph.cebu bot based on the amount of SP delegated. The minimum delegation is 20 SP by which author's post will be voted by the bot at 10% vote weight. In addition, members of the community whom SP is below or equal to 35 SP will recieve a 5% vote from @steemph.cebu bot. Other delegation amounts will receive  15%, 22%, 30%, 40%, 50% and  60% for 50 SP, 100 SP, 200 SP, 300 SP, 400 SP, and 500 SP, respectively. So, the post voted by the bot will have a fixed amount of reward based on the current rate. (You can read more about the new scheme from [What's the Hidden Motive with Steemph.cebu Delegation System?](https://busy.org/curation/@jassennessaj/what-s-the-hidden-motive-with-steemph-cebu-delegation-system))

Aside from the bot's fixed vote weight, the post voted by the @steemph.cebu bot will receive decent numbers of votes from the @steemph.cebu trail. Right now, the community trail has a total of 590 members. Majority of members has set their vote weight to auto in which they follow the vote weight set by the @steemph.cebu bot. The trail has 80 more members as compared to the last analysis conducted. However, their were 344 members in the community discord server. At the same time, community admins and moderators are still verifying each accounts.

Over the time, a significant growth of the @steemph.cebu bot was observe which was point out by the steady increase in the number of members has subscribed to the community trail. So, in this analysis, I would like to investigate the impact of the new voting and delegation system for @steemph.cebu bot in relation to the number of post, votes, and payouts. In addition, I would also include  a detailed presentation of the current SP delegation receives by @steemph.cebu bot.

True to its mission, the @steemph.cebu still support Cebuano authors who have not reach 35 SP at the time of implementation. This were designated as minnow trail follower in the community discord server. This members will receive a 5% vote from the bot so that this newbies of the community will stay and grow in Steemit.

#### 1.1 Objective

At the end of the analysis, we should be able to:
-  investigate the current SP delegation  received by @steemph.cebu; and,
-  evaluate the impact of the new delegation system in terms of the number of community members delegating SP and post voted by the bot.

#### 2. Github Repository: [TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu](https://github.com/TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu/)

### 3. Scopes and Limitation of the Analysis <hr>

#### 3.1 Scope
The analysis was performed using the data from [SteemSQL](www.steemsql.com) on 10 PM (PHI), June 24, 2018. The data where between April 1 and June 15, 2018 (post count), while for the delegation is between April 9 and June 24, 2018.  The time frame was considered based on the historical commits made on [TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu](https://github.com/TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu/commits). 

The last recorded update was on May 26 where the current voting and delegation system was released. The voting mechanism is depended on the amount of SP delegated as stated earlier. By which, vote weight percentage is between 5% to 60%. 

So, the query used to extract the data considers the delegation coming to the @steemph.cebu account has an effect on the number of post, votes and delegation. In addition, evaluate if the new delegation system could provide a good means and proof that it is the right path for the community. 

All data involve in the analysis where taken from the TxVotes, TxTransfers, and Comments table from the [SteemSQL](www.steemsql.com) database.  By which, the data are either an average or a count of the actual number of post, votes, payout, and SP delegation. Lastly, all data were subjected to statistical measure and plotting using Microsoft Excel.

#### 3.2 Limitation
In the analysis, the effects on rewards for each post voted by @steemph.cebu bot was not included. Also, withdrawal of SP delegation were left out. So, the analysis focuses on the delegation received and the number of  post voted by @steemph.cebu. 

### 4. Data Presentation and Result <hr>

### 4.1 An Overview
In the last few weeks, a drastic change in the voting mechanism for bot was implemented. It replaces the the previous voting rules to a delegation-based voting scheme. In the previous, the voting weight received by the community member is solely dependent on the admins settings. However, in the new voting system, the vote weight received by the members will be solely depended on the members SP delegation to the @steemph.cebu account. The new system was online and released in May 26, 2018([Commit #44 and #45](https://github.com/TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu/commits/master)).  

![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmW68ABce8RNnsgskUStdmsi8w2Z4MnK716NZPjc5gm1vU)

**Old Voting Scheme**. Previously, @steemph.cebu bot has voted an average of 100 posting daily. This post receives a vote weight of approximate to 9%. In addition, it also receives 116 votes, including bot's community trail. By the way, the old voting scheme can be traced in the April 9, 2018 update ([Commits #42 and #43](https://github.com/TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu/commits/master)).

**New Voting Scheme**. As stated earlier, the vote weight casted by @steemph.cebu bot will now depend on the SP delegated to @steemph.cebu. Each amount of SP delegated has an equivalent vote value. ([What's the Hidden Motive with Steemph.cebu Delegation System?](https://busy.org/curation/@jassennessaj/what-s-the-hidden-motive-with-steemph-cebu-delegation-system)). Currently, from May 26 to June 16, the daily number of post voted by the bot is close to 78 post. Each post receives an average vote count at 113 votes per day.


#### 4.2 Is there a decline on the number of post voted by @steemph.cebu bot?

<div class="pull-left">https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbwnZZySxEc6dAhDPVbuHvoFUBhonQCt3tnDeHumfVasb<br>https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYEJrF5A3CPXnerh5jWM7TmCrjAUm7FrWw3q2znyzmVjS</div> <br>Before the implementation of new delegation system, the data from April 9 to May 25 suggest an overall increasing trends in terms of the numbers of posts voted daily. On average, @steemph.cebu bot voted 116 times on the previous voting system. So, the number of post voted by the bot was steadily increasing between April 9 to May 25.
<br><br>
After the new system was in placed, a significant decline in the average was measured. It was found out that @steemph.cebu bot voted 113 votes daily. The decline in the number may not be too much as it is only 3 post less from the previous scheme. However, the data points projects a decreasing number of daily post voted by the bot. 
<br><br>
The decline does not mean that the new system was ineffective. The post count is a bit lower from the previous. In contrary, this suggest that the implementation of the new delegation system have sorted out the community from members that is only cashing out or using the bot to gain a decent rewards. In addition, the decline may also be attributed to the strong and diligent efforts of the community leader and moderator to sort out trail followers. In this way, only verified Cebuano authors  could be eligible for the @steemph.cebu bot vote.

#### 4.3 Support through delegation to @steemph.cebu

<div class="pull-right">https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSMs4R9QsoCgPb2iE3Np5FaRuonSbuLcALdsfcZZZZGFX<br>https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmepwa1rVfydoGbY95DVat3p1FqBaUtEb3GP9dMWKzAYwh<br>https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXZwcFkRBy81XPsjh1rwfTYu8G1aKs4kYWEF7JmNvYC9U</div>  <br><br>Since the new delegation system was released, the SP delegated to @steemph.cebu bot has reached close to 5, 440 SP. The total SP is from 64 distinct authors and members of the community trail. Majority of the 64 delegators have delegated at least 50 SP and below (roughly 70%). 
<br><br>
The numbers of delegators is only 10.85% of the total number of @steemph.cebu bot trail follower. Currently, there are 130 activated members whom are eligible for @steemph.cebu bot. Among these members, only 49.23% have delegated to @steemph.cebu. Majority of the amount of delegation is is less than 100 SP. This attributes to 87.50% of the number of delegation to the bot. 
<br><br><br>
<div class="pull-left">https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTtKFWoUbfSdjpWv4Cv1WrH4WRvyNU1R74At3ACGp5rVX<br>https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPqVX8vPse1Ef6Tg2zKjuGnfkmhyzuNnVVoAY33jhV3nU</div> <br> A decreasing amount of SP delegation was observe  over the last 30 days since the implementation of the new delegation system. In the first week of implementation, an overwhelming response from the community was felt. Around 3,000 SP delegations was received by the @steemph.cebu on the first week. 
<br><br>
In addition,  more SP delegations pours into the bot after two weeks. It has then accumulated  around 4,000 SP. So, 1,000 SP was accumulated in the second week of the implementation. However, the overwhelming adaptation of the community members have drastically drop after the first two weeks. As we can see from the plot, the 3rd and 4th week has recorded a total number of delegation around 1,200 SP.
<br><br>
Likewise, the number of delegators has been in a constant drop after the launch of the new delegation system. Sadly, the average number of delegator is equal to 2 delegators per day. Which means, the community has poorly respond to the new delegation system even with the overwhelming support in the first two weeks.
<br><br>
Right now, the new delegation system was not fully embraced by the community. In fact, the quantity of delegators is a bit mediocre to attest success. But, in a positive note, most of the members of the community holds lesser SP that they could not delegate yet. 
<br><br>
In addition, the overwhelming amount of SP received by the @steemph.cebu is still satisfying. Wherein, the new delegation system had a few success. So, I am looking forward that the number of delegations will significantly increased in the next few months.
<br><br>

### 5. Conclusion <hr>

It was a good start for the new delegation system. It has able to accumulate around 4000 SP in the first two weeks. Sadly, a substantial decline over the next two weeks has been observed. Over the last 30 days, SP delegation is steadily decreasing to the point that there were days with no delegation coming in. 

Sad to say, the new delegation system was unable to draw the attention of majority of community members. I think this could be attributed to members still eligible for @steemph.cebu bot vote even though there were no SP delegation, aside to those verified with less than 35 SP. Right now, members designated as stee

However, on a positive note,  many community members do not have sufficient SP to delegate. Currently, there were 71 activate minnow-trail-follower (less than 35 SP) in the community discord. So, we could still look forward for more engagement through SP delegation of these community members (minnow-trail-follower).

On the other hand, a decreasing trends in the number of post voted by @steemph.cebu bot was found out, after launching the new delegation system. The decrease in the post count is a natural effect as community members are still on the process of gaining new roles or not yet delegating on the community account. The decrease is not bad for the community.  The lower post count could be attributed to some community members that were not given roles on the community discord server. These members could either be new delegator rank, or unverified members. 

Right now, the community admins is verifying every users to ensure that all meets with the new delegation system. Aside from verification, there were members given with probationary status for little to no engagement in the @steemph.cebu community. The drop in the post count voted by the bot could be a sign of strict implementation of the new delegation system. In addition, this could help lessen possible abuse due to multiple accounts which may be used for milking the @steemph.cebu bot.

Overall, there was a warm acceptance of the new delegation system. However, the community members did not fully support the new system as delegation coming in is dropping steadily. Right now, there were only 64 members who currently delegate their SP to @steemph.cebu. We could hope that more SP coming as more minnow-trail-follower members till earning and growing their SP. In addition, the community core leader should strengthen their information drive for the new delegation system to the community members.

### 6. Tools and Query <hr>
The data used in the analysis is extracted from **Comments**, **TxVotes**, and **TxDelegationVestingShares** table on [SteemSQL](www.vip.steemsql.com), and imported on Microsoft Excel. All data statistics and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel. 

**Core Query**. (1.) The core query used to import the post and vote count is stated below:

<code>SELECT                  
    MONTH(Comments.created) AS [MONTH],             
    DAY(Comments.created) AS [DAY],                 
    COUNT(Comments.permlink) AS [NO_OF_POST],                   
    AVG(Comments.net_votes) AS [AVERAGE_NET_VOTES],                 
    AVG(Comments.total_payout_value)  AS [AVERAGE_PAYOUT],
   AVG(TxVotes.weight) AS [AVERAGE_VOTE_WEIGHT]                   
FROM Comments (NOLOCK)                  
INNER JOIN TxVotes (NOLOCK)                     
        ON TxVotes.permlink = Comments.permlink AND         
                   TxVotes.author = Comments.author                 
WHERE                   
    YEAR(Comments.created) = 2018 AND               
    TxVotes.timestamp >= '2018/04/09' AND                   
    TxVotes.timestamp < '2018/06/16' AND                    
    TxVotes.voter = 'steemph.cebu' AND                  
    TxVotes.author != 'steemph.cebu'                                    
GROUP BY                    
    MONTH(Comments.created),                
    DAY(Comments.created)</code>

(2.) The query used to obtain the data for the SP delegation to @steemph.cebu as follows:

<code>SELECT                  
    MONTH(TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp) AS [MONTH],             
    DAY(TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp) AS [DAY],                 
    TxDelegateVestingShares.delegator,                   
    TxDelegateVestingShares.vesting_shares                 
FROM TxDelegateVestingShares(NOLOCK)                                  
WHERE                   
    YEAR(TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp) = 2018 AND               
    TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp >= '2018/04/09' AND                   
    TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp < '2018/06/25' AND                    
    TxDelegateVestingShares.delegatee = 'steemph.cebu'                                    
GROUP BY                    
     MONTH(TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp),             
    DAY(TxDelegateVestingShares.timestamp),                 
    TxDelegateVestingShares.delegator,                   
    TxDelegateVestingShares.vesting_shares </code>


In addition, the data for the **members eligible for @steemph.cebu bot vote** is taken from the community discord server, [Teenvestor](https://discordapp.com/invite/BXmZcTX). For the bot updates mentioned in the text, the historical **commits** were based from [TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu](https://github.com/TeamMalaysia/Steemph.cebu).
